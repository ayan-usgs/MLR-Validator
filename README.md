# MLR-Validator
Validates inserts and updates to the MLR system

This project has been built and tested with python 3.6.x. To build the project locally you will need
python 3 and virtualenv installed.
```bash
% virtualenv --python=python3 env
% env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the tests:
```bash
env/bin/python -m unittest
```

To run the application locally execute the following:
```bash
% env/bin/python app.py
```

The swagger documentation can then be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:5000/api

Default configuration variables can be overridden be creating a .env file. For instance to turn debug on,
you will want to create an .env with the following:
```python
DEBUG = True
```

The two docker files provided pull the artifact from cida.usgs.gov/artifactory. The build type and version should be specfied as
build-arg's when building the image. The argument build_type should be 'snapshots' or 'releases'. The artfact_version
should be the version of the usgs-wma-mlr-validator that you want to be used in the docker container.
The optional build argument, 'listening_port' can be specified and defaults to 7010. This port will be exposed
by the container. To build within the DOI network, use Dockerfile-DOI and place the DOI cert in '/rootcrt'.
Below is an example of how to build and run.
```bash
% docker build --build-arg artifact_version=0.1.0.dev0 --build-arg build_type=snapshots -t validator -f Dockerfile-DOI .
% docker run --publish 5000:7010 validator
